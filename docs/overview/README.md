# bash2yaml

> Compile pure Bash scripts into your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Get IDE support for your scripts while keeping them
> centralized.

Tired of writing Bash inside YAML strings with no syntax highlighting, linting, or testing? `bash2yaml` lets you
develop your CI logic in `.sh` files and then compiles them into your GitLab CI configuration, giving you the
best of both worlds.

Bash in YAML is Bash without quality gates. Also, includes support for inlining a large number of scripts from other
language, from Python to PHP.

______________________________________________________________________

## Before

Surely Gitlab has a solution for this? Not as far as I can
tell. [Here are some of my best workarounds](https://gitlab.com/matthewdeanmartin/includes_templates).

Your IDE sees a single YAML string, and your scripts are trapped in one file.

`.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
build-job:
  script:
    - echo "Building project"
    - make build
```

## After

Your IDE provides full support for Bash, and your scripts can be versioned, shared, and tested independently.

`scripts/build.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eo pipefail

echo "Building project"
make build
```

`uncompiled.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
build-job:
  script:
    - ./scripts/build.sh
```

Run `bash2yaml compile`, and the final, valid `.gitlab-ci.yml` is generated for you.

______________________________________________________________________

## Who is this for?

This tool is for you if:

- You manage CI/CD templates in a centralized repository and `include:` them in many other projects.
- Your `.gitlab-ci.yml` files contain thousands of lines of shell scripts.
- You want to write, test, and debug your CI scripts locally without involving Docker or a full pipeline simulation.
- Your IDE's lack of Bash support in YAML files is slowing you down.
- You want to be able to put Python or other non-Bash scripts into your shared templates.

If your CI/CD configuration is simple or contained entirely within a single repository, you might not need this tool.

## Installation

`bash2yaml` is a standalone command-line tool. Installation with `pipx` is recommended to avoid dependency conflicts.

Install `[all]` extras for all commands. On your build server install just `bash2yaml` for the core libraries which
allows you to run `compile`, `decompile` on server. This minimizes supply chain risks.

```bash
# Recommended
pipx install bash2yaml[all]

# Or via pip
pip install bash2yaml[all]
```

## Getting Started: A Quick Tour

1. **Initialize Your Project**
   Run `bash2yaml init` to create a configuration file (`.bash2yaml.toml`) and directories to organize your source
   files.

1. **Decompile an Existing Configuration**
   If you have an existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` with inline scripts, you can extract them automatically:

```bash
bash2yaml decompile --in-file .gitlab-ci.yml --out my-project/
```

3. **Write and Edit Your Scripts**
   Create or edit your `.sh` files in the `scripts` directory. Write standard, clean Bash—your IDE will thank you. In
   your source YAML (`uncompiled.yml`):

```yaml
my-job:
  script:
    - ./scripts/my-script.sh
```

4. **Compile**
   Compile your source YAML and scripts into a final, GitLab-ready configuration:

```bash
bash2yaml compile --in my-project/ --out compiled/
```

This generates a `compiled/.gitlab-ci.yml` file, ready to be deployed to your project's root.

## Advanced Topics

#### Bash Completion

Enable tab completion in your shell by running the global activation command once:

```bash
activate-global-python-argcomplete
```

#### Global Variables

To define variables that should be inlined into the global `variables:` block of your `.gitlab-ci.yml`, create a
`global_variables.sh` file in your input directory.

#### Limitations

- **No `include:` Inlining:** This tool only inlines `.sh` file references. It does not process or merge GitLab's
  `include:` statements for other YAML files.
- **Single Statement Invocations:** The script invocation must be on its own line. Multi-statement lines like
  `echo "hello" && script.sh` are not supported.
- **Comments:** Comments in the source YAML may not be preserved in the final compiled output.

## How It Compares

- **[gitlab-ci-local](https://github.com/firecow/gitlab-ci-local):** This is an excellent tool for running your entire
  GitLab pipeline in local Docker containers. `bash2yaml` is different—it focuses on the "unit testing" of your Bash
  logic itself, assuming you can and want to execute your scripts on your local machine without the overhead of Docker.
- **GitHub Actions
  ** [GitHub composite actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/workflows-and-actions/reusable-workflows)
  do not have this problem. A shared GitHub action can reference a script in the shared action's repo. A GitHub
  "reusable" workflow is a single yaml file and might suffer from the same problem as Gitlab pipelines.
- **Git Submodules** Build runners will need permissions to clone and git is more complicated to use.
- **Base image holds all bash** You can only have one base image, so if you are using it for bash and yaml, you can't
  use other base images.
- **Trigger remote pipeline** A remote pipeline has access to the shell files in its own repo.
